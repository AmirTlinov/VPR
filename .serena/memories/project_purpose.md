VPR builds a single-operator stealth VPN that hides tunnels inside MASQUE/QUIC + Noise handshakes, deployable to one VPS via fully automated tooling (Terraform/Ansible + Python GUI). Core requirements: undetectable traffic against state-level DPI, hybrid PQ cryptography, adaptive cover traffic, “one button” operations (deploy, rotate, swap) plus rigorous telemetry and chaos validation.
